# What is parrier?
Parrier is a mod that implements the parry mechanic from ULTRAKILL into Minecraft. The original idea comes from [Xmaster476]([https://github.com/Xmaster476/ULTRA-PARRY](https://github.com/Xmaster476/)), who made a [mod](https://github.com/Xmaster476/ULTRA-PARRY) doing just this. I copied a bunch of his code, and build upon it, added configuration, and made the game actually freeze while the screen is flashing, instead of just the screen flash. I think it turned out nice, but that's not for me to judge - go play it yourself!

You can configure most things in the mod, and everything should be explained on the config screen.
